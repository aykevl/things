# Sandbox for electronics projects

This is my personal stash of small electronics projects, usually written using [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org).

I won't guarantee anything about it. All I can say is that it did work for me at some point and I like sharing what I made. Many things are written once and then mostly forgotten so I probably won't provide any support for any of the code.

## License

Feel free to use this code however you wish (in other words, you can treat it as public domain). Especially for small parts I won't mind if you just copy it in your project. For larger pieces of code or if you copy a project entirely, I would appreciate attribution somewhere (but it's not required).

If you prefer having an actual license for legal reasons, you can use the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) - but again, the code is public domain so no need to actually use this:
